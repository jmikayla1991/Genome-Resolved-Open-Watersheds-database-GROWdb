# Genome Resolved Open Watersheds database (GROWdb)
GROWdb is a community effort to increase genomic sampling and understanding of the global river corridor microbiome with an emphasis on creating a publicly available genome database. 

GROWdb networks efforts across researchers to move beyond a small collection of well-studied river systems, towards a spatially distributed, global network of systematic observations that are of appropriate scale and continuity to inform predictive models from local to global scales.
