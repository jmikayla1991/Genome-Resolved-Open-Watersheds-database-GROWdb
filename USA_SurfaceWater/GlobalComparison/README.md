[Nayfach, et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0718-6) - In an effort to catalog Earth's microbiomes, this study performed metagenomics on samples collected from diverse habitats covering all of Earth's continent and oceans. This comprehensive catalog includes 52,215 MAGs, of which we retain 5,336 MAGs from **aquatic freshwater** environments. Specifically these include **Aquatic, Environmental, Freshwater lake, Freshwater, Freshwater lake sediment, watersheds, Freshwater lentic, freshwater microbial mat, freshwater lake hypolimnion, Anoxic lake water, Surface water, Lake, Lentic,** and **Wetland** habitats. We have excluded soil, sediment, and wastewater related habitats within the aquatic freshwater ecosystem to more directly compare to GROW. Link to list of 5,336 MAGs used here. 


The reconstruction of bacterial and archaeal genomes from shotgun metagenomes has enabled insights into the ecology and evolution of environmental and host-associated microbiomes. Here we applied this approach to >10,000 metagenomes collected from diverse habitats covering all of Earthâ€™s continents and oceans, including metagenomes from human and animal hosts, engineered environments, and natural and agricultural soils, to capture extant microbial, metabolic and functional potential. This comprehensive catalog includes 52,515 metagenome-assembled genomes representing 12,556 novel candidate species-level operational taxonomic units spanning 135 phyla. The catalog expands the known phylogenetic diversity of bacteria and archaea by 44% and is broadly available for streamlined comparative analyses, interactive exploration, metabolic modeling and bulk download. We demonstrate the utility of this collection for understanding secondary-metabolite biosynthetic potential and for resolving thousands of new host linkages to uncultivated viruses. This resource underscores the value of genome-centric approaches for revealing genomic properties of uncultivated microorganisms that affect ecosystem processes.
