3. [Nayfach, et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0718-6) - In an effort to catalog Earth's microbiomes, this study performed metagenomics on samples collected from diverse habitats covering all of Earth's continent and oceans. This comprehensive catalog includes 52,215 MAGs, of which we retain 5,336 MAGs from **aquatic freshwater** environments. Specifically these include **Aquatic, Environmental, Freshwater lake, Freshwater, Freshwater lake sediment, watersheds, Freshwater lentic, freshwater microbial mat, freshwater lake hypolimnion, Anoxic lake water, Surface water, Lake, Lentic,** and **Wetland** habitats. We have excluded soil, sediment, and wastewater related habitats within the aquatic freshwater ecosystem to more directly compare to GROW.
